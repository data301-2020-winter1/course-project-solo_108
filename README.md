## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base. [1](#references)

The dataset here describes matches in dota.
I hope i can analyze this data to find some interesting
facts about the game for example, what heroes synergies
well together, what heroes have high win rates, or
which items works well on certain heroes.

I am interested in this topic because I play the game
and I always wanted to create an AI to play this game.
I think this is a good start to analyze some data about the game
and feed these data to make an AI that plays better than humans.

An specific question that I want to answer is to figure out
the best combination of heroes for a team.

This dataset has a great potential to have a Dashboard as there
are a lot of data available and more to infer from the dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The origin of the data comes from The [OpenDota Project](https://github.com/odota).

The dataset contains detailed description of some matches
in dota. A sample of a single match is in data/raw/matches_sample_small.json.

The data contains all the matches of dota upto last year. OpenDota
collects all the data that was officially provided by the game.
